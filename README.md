# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
This model is trained on a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to give real time face mask detection results. 

### Key points about the Project:
- A Small dataset of around one thousand images was taken to train this model
- Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) was built using Keras library
- OpenCv played an important role in getting real time data from the webcam
- A GUI interface(using tkinter library) is designed to make it user friendly
- This application also gives the user an option to upload an image and get the prediction
